# The Business Story

If you've ignored PowerShell up until now, or were skeptical about it, let's look at what Microsoft has done.

In **version 1**, PowerShell emerged as a the first management interface specifically designed for administrative automation. 

In **version 2**, PowerShell gained native remote management capabilities, enabling remote management of any server or client running PowerShell. PowerShell's "reach" extended to hundreds of management APIs, enabling real-world management. The product also matured a deceptively simple, powerful scripting language that can be used to build professional-grade units of automation.

In **version 3**, PowerShell learned to run long-running tasks in a disconnected, stateless fashion - called _workflows_. The product's reach extended even further, covering all major Microsoft server platforms, and pushing into Microsoft's cloud offerings. By this version, PowerShell was a very real thing, so much so that many Microsoft native GUIs began to use PowerShell "under the hood."

In **version 4**, PowerShell was extended with even more "reach," and gained a new technology: Desired State Configuration. DSC lets administrators describe, in more-or-less plain text, how a computer should be configured. Leveraging the existing investment in PowerShell, DSC then puts the machine into that state, and _keeps_ it there.

In **version 5**, PowerShell matured DSC and extended its "tool making" capabilities into professional developer space. With support in Visual Studio, PowerShell started to span a much broader spectrum of user, from entry-level administrators to advanced developers.

The point is that Microsoft has _clearly_ been building PowerShell since its v1 release in 2006. They've done so in a way that _they've never done before_ in languages like VBScript, and they've done so while maintaining consistency and efficiency.

What's more, PowerShell has inspired a broad ecosystem of supporting vendors, and an enthusiastic global community. Administrators are, more than ever, able to get assistance, answers, and even ready-made solutions from those vendors and that community.
